elaborate阐述

I should elaborate on this. Regular exprssions are greedy, and try to match as much as possible. "[a-z]*" matches zero or more lower case letters, and tries to be as big as possible. The ".*" matches zero or more characters after the first match. Since the first one grabs all of the lower case letters, the second matches anything else. Therefore if you type(http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html#uh-0)

escaped parentheses转义括号
To review, the escaped parentheses (that is, parentheses with backslashes before them) remember portions of the regular expression. You can use this to exclude part of the regular expression. The "\1" is the first remembered pattern, and the "\2" is the second remembered pattern. Sed has up to nine remembered patterns.

fret担心
Anyhow, sed is a marvelous utility. Unfortunately, most people never learn its real power. The language is very simple, but the documentation is terrible. The Solaris on-line manual pages for sed are five pages long, and two of those pages describe the 34 different errors you can get. A program that spends as much space documenting the errors than it does documenting the language has a serious learning curve.
Do not fret! It is not your fault you don't understand sed. I will cover sed completely. But I will describe the features in the order that I learned them. I didn't learn everything at once. You don't need to either.
