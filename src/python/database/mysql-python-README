MySQLdb Installation
====================



Building and installing
-----------------------


Finally, putting it together::

  $ tar xfz MySQL-python-1.2.1.tar.gz
  $ cd MySQL-python-1.2.1
  $ # edit site.cfg if necessary
  $ python setup.py build
  $ sudo python setup.py install # or su first


Windows
.......

I don't do Windows. However if someone provides me with a package for
Windows, I'll make it available. Don't ask me for help with Windows
because I can't help you.

Generally, though, running setup.py is similar to above::

  C:\...> python setup.py install
  C:\...> python setup.py bdist_wininst

The latter example should build a Windows installer package, if you
have the correct tools. In any event, you *must* have a C compiler.
Additionally, you have to set an environment variable (mysqlroot)
which is the path to your MySQL installation. In theory, it would be
possible to get this information out of the registry, but like I said,
I don't do Windows, but I'll accept a patch that does this.

On Windows, you will definitely have to edit site.cfg since there is
no mysql_config in the MySQL package.


Zope
....

If you are using a binary package of Zope, you need run setup.py with
the python executable that came with Zope. Otherwise, you'll install
into the wrong Python tree and Zope (ZMySQLDA) will not be able to
find _mysql.


Binary Packages
---------------

I don't plan to make binary packages any more. However, if someone
contributes one, I will make it available. Several OS vendors have
their own packages available.


RPMs
....

If you prefer to install RPMs, you can use the bdist_rpm command with
setup.py. This only builds the RPM; it does not install it. You may
want to use the --python=XXX option, where XXX is the name of the
Python executable, i.e. python, python2, python2.4; the default is
python. Using this will incorporate the Python executable name into
the package name for the RPM so you have install the package multiple
times if you need to support more than one version of Python. You can
also set this in setup.cfg.


Red Hat Linux
.............

MySQL-python is pre-packaged in Red Hat Linux 7.x and newer. This
includes Fedora Core and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. You can also
build your own RPM packages as described above.


Debian GNU/Linux
................

Packaged as `python-mysqldb`_::

	# apt-get install python-mysqldb

Or use Synaptic.

.. _`python-mysqldb`: http://packages.debian.org/python-mysqldb


Ubuntu
......

Same as with Debian.


Gentoo Linux
............

Packaged as `mysql-python`_. ::

      # emerge sync
      # emerge mysql-python
      # emerge zmysqlda # if you use Zope

.. _`mysql-python`: http://packages.gentoo.org/search/?sstring=mysql-python
